# Halkan's Rockhouse

This is an individual student project. I made a new site for vintage guitar store Halkan's Rockhouse. 
[This is what the site looked like before](https://web.archive.org/web/20180804092400/http://halkans.com/) and [this is what the site looks like today](http://www.halkans.com)

I made the design together with Halkan after his explicit wishes it would not look too modern.

The new site is a responsive Wordpress site based on the [Underscores starter theme](https://underscores.me). I've used HTML, SASS, PHP and jQuery to build it.
